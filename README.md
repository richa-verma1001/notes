#### Prequisites ####
Get your local webserver up and runing. If using MAC OS it comes with built-in apache server. Update the useraname.conf, httpd.conf and others to get the server pulling files from development directories. Depending on what OS you are running there are many cheatsheets that walk through the steps to do this. e.g. https://tech-cookbook.com/2020/11/14/setting-up-your-local-web-server-on-macos-big-sur-11-0-1-2020-mamp-macos-apache-mysql-php/

Some getting started videos that I liked -

* Recommended Atom plugins - 'browser-refresh-on-save', 'EMMET', etc. -

* I setup browser-refresh-on-save inside Atom editor. Its a package that can be downloaded. Its great, it does auto refresh in browser when browser file changes in editor. e.g. open http://localhost/JSWork/arrays/index.html in browser and corresponding in editor.
