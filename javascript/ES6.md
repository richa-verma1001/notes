# About ES6

## Lets get started
+ Your primary source to ES6 documentation - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/
+ Checkout codepen or scrimba to run JS exercises or snippets.
+ Add enough comments and its still done via // or /* this \*/


## Get your basics right

+ Bytes and bits - 1 byte is 8 bits (Yes, very basic revision)
+ ASCII - Has 128 characters with values 0 thru 127. Its a 8 BIT CHARACTER SET where all characters can be represented within 8 bits. http://www.asciitable.com/
+ Unicode - This is 16 bit character set designed to cover all of the major living languages. All characters occupy the same space. http://www.robelle.com/smugbook/unicode.html
+ UTF-8:  Uses 8 bit character ENCODING and can be as compact as ASCII as long as all the characters are plain English text.
+ UTF-16:  

### Datatypes
> undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, object

### Types of variables aka Variable declaration
> const, let, var
+ const - read only, blocked scoped
+ let - blocked scope, optional initialization to a value
+ var - has global scope  // e.g. \_numOfApples
+    A variable that is not initialized has value undefined


```
    a = a + 5; >> a += 5;
    b = b - 1; >> b -= 1;
    a = a * 5; >> a \*= 5;
    b = b / 4; >> b /= 4;
```
