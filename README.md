Some getting started videos that I liked -

* Recommended Atom plugins - 'browser-refresh-on-save', 'EMMET', etc. -

* I setup browser-refresh-on-save inside Atom editor. Its a package that can be downloaded. Its great, it does auto refresh in browser when browser file changes in editor. e.g. open http://localhost/JSWork/arrays/index.html in browser and corresponding in editor. 
* Initial Setup file example - /Users/rverma/Sites/JSWork/index.html
* Pickup a CSS library like Bootstrap or other - https://getbootstrap.com/
