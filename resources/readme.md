One of the many painpoints and challenges that I face as a software developer is being able to stay on top of the changing software tools, languages and conventions as we adopt new patterns and languages into our day to day development. As a result, I am compiling this resource section to jot notes on 1. Getting started 2. Staying current

#### Staying current
* https://www.thebalance.com/the-10-best-web-development-youtube-channels-2071397 - Top channels as your source of education

* https://youtu.be/sBzRwzY7G-k - Very helpful video for an overview of the different technologies in web development, what is new and what is starting to fade (LearnCode.academy - Also has playlists on main technologies like React, Redux, CSS languages like SASS or Less, etc and using Bootstrap library)
